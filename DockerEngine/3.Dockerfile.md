# CMD vs RUN

*RUN*: the run command is used to run any shell commands. these commands will run on top of the base image layer. run commands executed during the build time. you can use this command any number of times in dockerfile.

*CMD*: the cmd command doesnâ€™t execute during the build time it will execute after the creation of the container. there can be only one cmd command in dockerfile. if you add more than one cmd commands the last one will be executed and remaining all will be skipped. cmd command you can use in two types one is as executable for and another one is parameters form.

    executable form:
    
        CMD ["java","-jar","/path/jarName.jar"]
        
        CMD ["py","install.py"]

    parameters form:

        ENTRYPOINT ["/script.sh"]
        CMD ["patameter"]


# CMD vs ENTRYPOINT


# Dokcer image vs container
  
     A docker image is an immutable(not modifiable) file that contains code, dependencies, libraries, tools and the whole runtime environment which is needed in order to run the application. It has a read-only functionality, It is a multi-layered file, build to execute the code and run the application. 
  
     Docker container is nothing but a runtime instance of an image. 

 
Docker container and its layers, we can't remove docker image while container in use.
